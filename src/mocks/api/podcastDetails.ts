    'Hosted by Flea, founding member and bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, This Little Light is a podcast about falling in love with music. Flea interviews musical guests from all genres to discuss the teachers who guided them, the influences that inspired them, and how the lessons they learned as young musicians have shaped their creativity, resilience, and careers. Guests range from legends to rising stars, and include Rick Rubin, Patti Smith, Thundercat Margo Price, and Cynthia Erivo. The podcast is produced by Cadence13 and Parallel, with proceeds benefiting the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a Los Angeles-based non-profit that Flea co-founded in 2001.',

        'Finneas’ music education and evolution, from 1. Realizing music could be a career after seeing Green Day in concert at age 11 → 2. Falling in love with music as a kid in the backseat of his parents’ minivan → 3. Learning his first song on piano to impress a girl → 4. Forming a band with his high school friends and recording one of their first songs with his sister Billie Eilish → 5. Signing their first record deal at age 18 and 13 respectively → 6. Evolving into a producer → 7. Finneas’ advice to aspiring musicians\n\nAcademy Award- and GRAMMY Award-winning singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer FINNEAS has quietly emerged as an unassumingly ubiquitous presence in popular music and culture. He introduced a heartfelt and hypnotic style on 2019’s debut Blood Harmony EP highlighted by the gold-certified “Let’s Fall in Love for the Night.” 2021 saw him unveil his full-length debut, The Optimist [Interscope Records]. It arrived to widespread acclaim from Rolling Stone, DIY, The Line of Best Fit, and NME. At the same time, he landed on the covers of publications such as V Man, L’Officiel Hommes USA, Billboard, and Mix Magazine and late-night television shows a la Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel LIVE!. He packed houses on headline tours and performed at festivals such as Coachella. His catalog grew to encompass popular collaborations with Ashe, Ringo Starr, and Lizzy McAlpine in addition to producing and/or co-writing tracks Justin Bieber, Halsey, Demi Lovato, Kid Cudi, girl in red, James Bay, Selena Gomez, Camila Cabello, and Tove Lo. He achieved stratospheric success for his work with his sister Billie Eilish, including eight GRAMMY Awards, headline sets at Coachella and Glastonbury, and an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award both in the category of “Best Original Song” for “No Time To Die” from No Time To Die—which he co-wrote and co-produced. He expanded his oeuvre as a sought-after composer. His filmography boasts original scores for HBO Max’s award-winning The Fallout and BJ Novak’s Vengeance. For the Disney PIXAR animated hit Turning Red, he and Billie wrote all of the music for the film’s boyband 4*Town. Not to mention, he produced the tracks, contributed vocals, and inhabited the role of Jesse. FINNEAS continues to evolve, expand, and engage in 2023 and beyond.\n\nFollow Silverlake Conservatory of Music at @silverlake_conservatory \nFor more information on Parallel, visit parallel.la\nFollow Cadence13 at @cadence13\nFollow Finneas at @finneas \nFollow Flea at @flea333\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n \n Learn more about your ad choices.
